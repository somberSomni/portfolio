        would argue making the UI simple is the crux of the development process. My exprience ranges from creating small apps to large single page applications for
        shopping. Let me bring your vision to live with clean animations, quick turnarounds and mobile friendly designs`,

        information is the backbone of any great website. For servers, I typically use Nodejs to keep all my javascript

        I currently stick with no sql to avoid the tangled with of working with relational tables, but for legacy projects
        I revert back to SQL as it still is a solid langauge for handling large data sets.`,

        into a project, I make sure to account for download time and memory leaks. A mesmerizing website isn't good if it takes
