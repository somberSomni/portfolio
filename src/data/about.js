    bio: `As a programmer, on a month to month basis I code in a wide range 
    of computer languages ranging from shell scripting to javascript. 
    I've delved into many books on the topic, and essentially what bonds
    all these different languages together is the concept of inputs and 
    outputs. I've built simple fire alarms using an Arduino and a 
    temperature sensor which sends input to your computer as a voltage, 
    and runs a program to display the temperature in a readable form you 
    can manage. I've worked for over five years as a freelance web 
    designer creating dynamically interactive experiences, and as a 
    back-end developer I dealt with the server side of database 
    manipulation. All these separate experiences allow me to give my 
    students different ideas of what to use programming for and allows 
    them to pursue multiple career paths of their choosing.`,
